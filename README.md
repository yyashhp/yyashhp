<h2> Current Research & Programming Interests and Related Endeavours
  </h2>
<h3> Neural Networks </h3>

* At the REU: Computing For Structure site, my research will focus on building Neural Networks that are optimized for large and complex datasets

* Combining my interests with quant finance, I am reading on the use of Neural Networks for classification in portfolio building
  >Additionally, I am reading on the use of Bayesian Neural Networks for out of distribtuion detection within time series

<br/>

* I am exploring Neural Networks that utilize game theory, with the goal of further integrating principles of game theory into agent behavior

<br/>
<h3> Portfolio Optimization </h3>


* I have recently read the paper on and implemented Marcos Lopez De Prado's Hierarchichal Risk Parity Portfolio Allocation strategy
  >His paper garned my interest in alternative methods to the classic CLA proposed by Harry Markowitz, so I am reading into those methods and their intracacies

* Exploring potential use cases for Neural Networks within portfolio optimization, most likely for classificaton purposes as regression seems to not be robust enough...

<br/> 
<h3> Game Theory </h3>

* As I plan to found the Game Theory Association at the University of Miami in Fall 2023, and be president, I am both brainstorming for events and key speakers to invite, as well as diving into the field myself, particularly its applications in poker(a game I love)
  >As a result, I am keen to find ways to implements my learning and game theory into my quant and ML endeavours, reading papers on their discovered interesections

<br/>

<h3> I am always open for conversation! </h3>
